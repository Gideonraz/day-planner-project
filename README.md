# day-planner-project
In this assignment I made a day planner website to track all the hours of the day and set events. First I created my html page and connected my css and js files to it. Next, I used a nav tag with a class and created a div class underneath that and titled it Work Day Planner. Then I created the footer and wrote a message in there. After I was done with the html I went into js file and started my code. First I used (moment) to create the date on top of the page so it is updating according to the day, month and year. Next I made sure my todos would be stored in the local storage by parsing the JSON string to an object. Next, I set the variable planner element for the planner part itself. Then I built the calendar from 8 AM to 10 PM. Next I adjusted all the rows so they can fit on the page properly on a desktop and smartphone. In between I added code to my css so I could use it in my Javascript to edit the colors of the rows. Next I added a on click function for the save button I created and added the color for it. After a bit of troubleshooting I was able to complete this project.
